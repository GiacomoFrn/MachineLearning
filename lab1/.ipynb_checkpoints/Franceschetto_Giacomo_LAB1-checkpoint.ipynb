    "It is common practice in Statistics and Machine Learning to scale the data (= each variable) so that it is centered (zero mean) and has standard deviation equal to 1. This helps in terms of numerical conditioning of the (inverse) problems of estimating the model (the coefficients of the linear regression in this case), as well as to give the same scale to all the coefficients."

Moreover, in the previous example we obtained a test error smaller than the training one and we justified that stating that we were dealing with a smaller dataset. In that case we can suppose that the model was working very well so the difference was not in the region of the dataset explored but in the dimension of it. Now we can suppose that the training  was not ideal, so the algorithm works differently in various region of the dataset. Furthermore, it work better on the region were it was trained and worse in the test region."
